History of development 
I was working with Bitbucket on my private projects for a long time. I wanted to switch from FTP deployment into GIT. I mean, when I commit something to my private Bitbucket repo I wanted it to appear on my shared webhosting server too, without FTP syncing. 

How script works? 
1. It gets last commits zip 
2. Deletes all files recursively from your web hosting 
3. Unzips .zip file contents into destination folder that you set (By default destination folder is root) 

Installation 
1. Upload deploy.php into your webhosting server 
2. Set your BitBucket username, password and repo name 
3. Configure your private repo to send POST into deploy.php when you commit. Here is how to: http://goo.gl/9weh8 
4. That's it
